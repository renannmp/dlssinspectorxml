## Tips
Explaining some settings, let's say you want to force a game to use latest DLSS DLL, Enable "Super Resolution Override" and set "Super Resolution Preset" to "Latest Preset", you can do the same for Ray Reconstruction and Frame Generation.

"Override" means that the driver will attempt to use a DLL in the driver repository to replace the game one.
